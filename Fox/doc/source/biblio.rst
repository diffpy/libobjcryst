Authors
=======

FOX was developed by **Vincent Favre-Nicolin**, in collaboration with **Radovan Cerny** at the Laboratory of Crystallography of the `University of Geneva, Switzerland <http://www.unige.ch/>`_, with support from the `Swiss National Science Foundation <http://www.snf.ch/>`_ (project #21-53847.98, 2000-2001).

Vincent Favre-Nicolin continued the project (but not as a main research project) while working at `ESRF` (2001-2002),
at the `Université Grenoble Alpes <https://univ-grenoble-alpes.fr>`_ (2002-).

*Note*: **This is a free, open-source project**. If there is something that you would like to see in it, you can contribute to it by submitting bugs, new code, help improving the documentation. See the `github project page <https://github.com/vincefn/objcryst>` for more details about the source code.
