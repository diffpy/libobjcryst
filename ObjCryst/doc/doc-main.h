*\section intro Introduction
*\par Overview of the project
*
* The aim of this project is to provide object-oriented tools for Crystallography. The
* focus of these tools is the analysis of diffraction data (mostly powder diffraction),
* with an emphasis on speed optimization for repetitive calculations (for global
* refinement methods such as simulated annealing, for example).
*
*\par
* To have an <b>overview of all available libraries</b>, go to the <a href="hierarchy.html">Class Hierarchy</a>.
* You are probably interested in the main Crystallographic classes, including:
* * Crystal: the base class describing a complete crystal structure
* * Scatterer: the base class for a scatterer, including:
*   * Atom
*   * Molecule
* * ScatteringData, including:
*   * DiffractionDataSingleCrystal
*   * PowderPatternDiffraction
* * PowderPattern: describing a complete powder pattern with multiple phases, background
* * PowderPatternComponent: can be derived to:
*   * PowderPatternBackground
*   * PowderPatternDiffraction
* * SpaceGroup: with all the spacegroup and symmetry information, interfacing with cctbx
* * RefinableObj: the base refinable object with a list of parameters - all
*   objects are derived from it.
* * RefinablePar: the base refinable paremeter, which is used in all RefinableObj
* * Algorithm classes:
*   * OptimizationObj, from which MonteCarloObj is derived
*   * LSQNumObj: least-squares minimisation
*   * CellExplorer: class for the volume dichotomy algorithm
*
*\par
* Even if we intend to use this library mainly for the development of a global optimization
* program from powder diffraction, this library is programmed in a general way so that
* other applications can make use of it.
* The library was designed to be reusable, by adding new kind of experiments, new algorithms,
* new Scatterer type, new ScatteringPower,...
*
*\par
* <b>There are two main usage of the ObjCryst++ library today, and you are encouraged
* to start using those, unless you already know you want to use the C++ library</b>:
* * \b Fox, 'Free Objects for Xtallography' is an application for Linux, macOS and windows
*   which can be <a href="https://github.com/vincefn/objcryst/releases">downloaded from GitHub</a>,
*   and can be used mainly to solve crystal structures from powder diffraction
* * \b pyobjcryst is the python module which can be used as an interface to a large
*   part of the ObjCryst++ library: see the <a href="https://pyobjcryst.readthedocs.io/">documentation</a>
*   and the <a href="https://github.com/diffpy/pyobjcryst">github project</a>), including
*   <a href="https://pyobjcryst.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html"> example notebooks</a>.

* This project was initiated in the laboratory of Crystallography of the University
* of Geneva (http://www.unige.ch/), and is part of the development of a global
* optimization program with Radovan Cerny (https://www.unige.ch/societes/SSCr/w3cerny/rcerny.htm).
* \par
* This project has been supported by the <a href="http://www.snf.ch/">Swiss
* National Science Foundation (#21-53847.98)</a>.
*
*\par
* This project also makes use of some other programs or libraries. Most notable in this
* project is the cctbx library originally written by R. Grosse-Kunstleve
* (see \ref page_legal).
